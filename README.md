Minishell represents a collaborative endeavor where I teamed up with my friend [Anass Bouhmad](https://github.com/ghostbhd) to develop a fundamental shell program in C. This project showcases our successful implementation of key features, including redirections, pipes, environment variable expansions, and a range of essential built-in commands such as cd, echo, env, exit, export, pwd, and unset.
